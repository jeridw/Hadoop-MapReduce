# Hadoop-MapReduce

## Analysing Weather Data using Hadoop and Map Reduce.

One of my main objectives was to gain a deeper insight into July's daily weather patterns, identifying extreme conditions like high winds or low humidity, which might signal weather fronts, storms, or fire risks. Another critical objective was to apply the MapReduce computational model to a large dataset. My analysis follows a structured approach including:

- Data Preparation and Exploration: Setting up the data within the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and exploring the dataset.
- MapReduce Task Execution: Implementing MapReduce tasks to compute descriptive statistics to identify patterns and anomalies in the weather data.
- Apply machine learning techniques using Apache Mahout for clustering analysis to understand the data patterns and find the optimal K.
